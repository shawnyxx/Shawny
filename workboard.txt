Shawny Features


Time manager:

The game will have a time manager that handles all the logic and events in the game.
1 second = 1 day
30 or 31 days = one month
365 seconds (days) = one year (unless it's a bissextile year)

The time manager will run all the time and will trigger a save every year (365-366 days/seconds)




.

Saving and loading progress:

All the variables for the games will be stored in the browser local storage unless the player is a registered ecxogames user (which we will need to implement very early)

Saving options:
	- Every year: (365-366 days/seconds), the game saves either to the local-storage or to its user account data.
	- Manually: If the user wants to make sure he doesn't loose his progress, he can also save the game manually from the settings menu
	- Auto-saving: The game also saves automatically every 30 seconds in a very light json file in local-storage in case of a unexpected issue with the game
		> it can be loaded from the settings
		> it will ask you if you wish to recover your save when joining back after a crash or forced closed

Loading options:
	- When you die: When you die, it shows an option to load a save or to start a new game (but it doesn't show you the last save of the game you just died because it would be cheating)
	- When you launch the game for the first: When you just logged in on a new device
	- From the settings: You can load a game from the settings

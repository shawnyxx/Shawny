Hi there, you are pretty early...

My name is Sean-Xavier and I am the lead developer of this project. The concept behind this project is to make a big web games platform containing good ad free games.

My team and I are working on something bigger than that. Working on an API that allows other devs to include their games into our platform which will also allow them to monetize their games. If you are seing this now, the project is in its earliest phase, meaning that we don't have anything special to show.

Anyway, I hope that you have a great day and I will get back to work...
